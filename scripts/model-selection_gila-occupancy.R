## Elevation is highly correlated with shrub density and air temperature. Biologically this makes sense to me, with higher elevations being associated with more shrub density
# (vegetative diversity/communities), and cooler temperatures.

# look at coefficients of the Global Model 
model_global <- glm(detection ~ rockiness + elevation + air_temp + prey_presence + shrub_density, family = binomial, data = gm_df)

# Variance Inflation Factor
check_collinearity(model_global)
# All VIF scores are low (<5) which means there is some correlation but not too severe.

# ---- Establishing Hypotheses ----
# Global Model: model_global < - glm(detection ~ rockiness + elevation + air_temp + prey_presence + shrub_density, family = binomial, data = gm_df)

# Model 1: model_01 <- glmer(detection ~ rockiness + elevation + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probability increases on sandier transects due to tracks being more easily detected in loose substrates, and lower-elevation transects where thermal conditions and 
  # refugia availability increases Gila monster activity.

# Model 2: model_02 <- glmer(detection ~ rockiness + air_temp + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probability increases on sandier transects and during warmer air temperatures (with the caveat of this not being a continuous linear regression).

# Model 3: model_03 <- glmer(detection ~ rockiness + shrub_density + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probability increases on sandier, more sparsely vegetated transects where visibility and surface activity are greater, and declines on rockier, more shrub-dense transects.

# Model 4: model_04 <- glmer(detection ~ rockiness + prey_presence + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probability increases on sandy transects and where adult prey were observed the most. Foraging opportunities increase above-ground activity and activity is most easily detected
  # on sandier substrates.

# Model 5: model_05 <- glmer(detection ~ rockiness + shrub_density + prey_presence + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probabiltiy increases on sandier transects with prey present but declines with higher shrub density; rockier, shrub-dense habitats reduce detectability unless prey availability boosts surface activity.
  # Such as in creosote-white bursage habitat where tortoises and ground-nesting birds lay their eggs.

# Model 6: model_06 <- glmer(detection ~ shrub_density + prey_presence + (1|site_id/transect_id), family = binomial, data = gm_df)
  # Detection probability increases with prey presence as animals spend more time foraging above ground and decreases with shrub density due to visual obstruction, though more prey might be present.

# Looking at the output, there is plenty of evidence for *rockiness* and *air temp*, but much less for *elevation*, *shrub density*, or *prey presence*.

model.avg(gm_models, revised.var = TRUE)

# ---- Interpretation ----
# Can now report the model averaged coefficients for the predictor variables individual effects on detection probability.
# Used to average regression coefficients across multiple models with the ultimate goal of capturing a variable’s overall “effect.”
summary(model.avg(gm_models, subset = delta < 2)) 

# Intercept: high p-value most likely because of the low amount of detections
# Detection probability increases as the rockiness index increases; in this case the results suggest that detections are more likely on sandier transects
# Detection probability increases with air temperature; biologically this (mostly) makes sense as Gilas are ectotherms and have greater surface activity at
  # warmer temperatures; HOWEVER they to have a low tolerance for high temperatures so this relationship is not continuous in reality.
# Elevation has little influence on detection after accounting for the substrate texture and air temperture.
# Conditional average = only includes models where the variable appears.
  # Here nearly identical to the full average, so variable inclusion is consistent across top models.
# Thus the supported hypothesis is that Gila monster detection probability increases with warmer air temperatures and sandier substrates with elevation playing a minor role.

# Adding in the mixed-effects models changes our results completely. By taking in to account the random effects of site and transect, the only supported model is model 13:
# which uses shrub density and prey presence as the predictor variables. This leads us to conclude that 
# Detection probability of Gila monsters 
# Prey presence contributed little to detection, implying that Gila monster activity (and thus detectability) is more governed by thermal ecology than by immediate prey abundance cues.
# Temperature provides a major explanatory gain.
# Adding other predictors (rockiness, elevation, shrub density) increased AICc without improving fit — meaning they didn’t add useful information.
# The random intercepts (1 | site_id/transect_id) improved the model compared with non-mixed GLMs, capturing spatial structure among transects.
